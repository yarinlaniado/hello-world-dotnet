I need to:

- prepare a sonarqube server and connect it in azure devops:
 * new azure vm with
	+ docker installed
	+ sonarqube image pulled and binded to port 9000
	+ open port
 * Run SonarQube scan on the project + integrate with azure devops

- Create NuGet file from the DLL, and upload it to Artifacts. 
(Use the correct repo type)
 * ???

- Using tag, the name of the artifact should be <branch_name>_<version>.
 Print the version number to the console.
 * ???

-  Send an e-mail with the status of the pipeline (success or failure).
 * implement integration with azure devops and sending (smtp server) 
   and sending mail in azure
