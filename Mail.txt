Hello X,

Here is the overview of the home assignment , which involves setting up Azure Devops pipeline,I created a .NET "Hello world" project,
set up a CI/CD pipeline for Azure Artifacts, and added a conditional pipeline with SonarQube scanning, NuGet packaging, and email
notifications for status updates.
For more information about the execution of the task, please refer to the md file called “readme.md” on GITHUB:
